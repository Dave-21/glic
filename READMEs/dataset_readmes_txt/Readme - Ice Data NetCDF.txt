Data Description
This dataset is part of the Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis (GLSEA), a digital map of the Great Lakes surface water temperature that is produced daily. 
This particular dataset combines surface water temperature data and ice coverage data from the U.S. National Ice Center. Both the surface water temperature data and ice coverage data are included in the variable “temp”, where positive values indicate surface water temperature in degree Celsius and negative values indicate ice coverage in fraction (e.g., -1 indicate 100% ice cover, -0.5 indicate 50% ice cover).  
The NetCDF (.nc) file contains the data for the period January 11, 2019 to January 31, 2019. The horizontal resolution is about 1.3 km. 

The data file can be opened and read by the CoastWatch Utility Software (link below), any NetCDF utility software (e.g., ncview), Python, R, or another programming language.
