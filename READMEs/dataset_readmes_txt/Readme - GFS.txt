Data Description
The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model of National Centers Environmental Prediction's suite of numerical guidance, providing global atmospheric and wave predictions at 13 km resolution. The GFS is run four times a day, producing forecasts up to 16 days in advance. 

The particular subset of the data provided are surface condition analyses of wind, air temperature, relative humidity, pressure at mean sea level, total cloud cover, and precipitation rate. The data is provided at 0.25o horizontal resolution. 


Data Source
The dataset is obtained from the historical archive of the GFS analysis and forecasts.
