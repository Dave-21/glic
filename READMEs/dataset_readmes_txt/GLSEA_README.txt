Data Description
This dataset is part of the Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis (GLSEA), a digital map of the Great Lakes surface water temperature that is produced daily.
The lake surface temperatures are satellite-derived from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP), NOAA-20, and NOAA-21 spacecraft.
The NetCDF (.nc) file contains the variable temp, which represents the Great Lakes surface water temperature for the period January 11, 2019 to January 31, 2019.
Valid data values in the variable correspond to the water surface temperature in degrees Celsius.  The horizontal resolution is about 1.3 km. 
The data file can be opened and read by the CoastWatch Utility Software (link below), any NetCDF utility software (e.g., ncview), Python, R, or another programming language.
