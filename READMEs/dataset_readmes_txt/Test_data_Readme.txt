Data Description
This folder contains weather and ice data files for the 4-day (96 hour) test period, which will be used to predict ice conditions on each day. In all data files below, the actual time information is removed, and replaced by dummy information (starting at 1500-07-01). The ice and water surface temperature conditions on the first day are provided as the initial conditions. Predictions for ice conditions should be made for today (initial condition + 1 day), day 1 (initial condition + 2 day), day 2 (initial condition + 3 day), and day 3 (initial condition + 4 day).  Participants may have some discretion on what hours represent each day: For example, today, day 1, day 2, and day 3 may be represented by data at hour 24, 48, 72, and 96, respectively, or at averages of hour 13-36, 37-60, 61-84, 85-96, respectively.  
Weather Data
hrrr_weather_test_period.nc: This is weather information from NOAA’s High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR). The HRRR is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-h period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km radar-enhanced Rapid Refresh . The particular subset of the data provided are surface condition analyses of wind, air temperature, relative humidity, pressure at mean sea level, total cloud cover, and precipitation rate. The data is provided at about 3 km horizontal resolution. The data format is the same as that was provided for the training dataset, except that the time information is removed. The data covers a 4-day period. 

gfs_weather_test_period.nc:  This is weather information from NOAA’s Global Forecast System (GFS). GFS is a weather forecast model of National Centers Environmental Prediction's suite of numerical guidance, providing global atmospheric and wave predictions at 13 km resolution. The GFS is run four times a day, producing forecasts up to 16 days in advance. The particular subset of the data provided are surface condition analyses of wind, air temperature, relative humidity, pressure at mean sea level, total cloud cover, and precipitation rate. The data is provided at 0.25o horizontal resolution. The data format is the same as that was provided for the training dataset, except that the time information is removed. The data covers a 4-day period. 

Ice & Water Surface Temperature Initial Conditions
glsea_ice_test_initial_condition.nc: This dataset is part of the Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis (GLSEA), a digital map of the Great Lakes surface water temperature that is produced daily. This particular dataset combines surface water temperature data and ice coverage data from the U.S. National Ice Center. Both the surface water temperature data and ice coverage data are included in the variable “sst”, where positive values indicate surface water temperature in degree Celsius and negative values indicate ice coverage in fraction (e.g., -1 indicate 100% ice cover, -0.5 indicate 50% ice cover).  The NetCDF (.nc) file contains the data for the initial date only (i.e., the first day of the 4-day period for which the weather data is provided for). The horizontal resolution is about 1.3 km. The data is provided at the same 1024x1024 grid as the ice data in the training dataset (ascii and netcdf), as well as the GLSEA data.

glsea_ice_test_initial_condition.asc:  This provides the same information as the above (glsea_ice_test_initial_condition.nc). The land area mask is represented by 255.0, and for ice covered areas, the values are 99.XXX and the decimal values represent ice concentration. For example, the value 99.050 represents 50% ice concentration; the value 99.100 represents 100% ice concentration. 

ice_test_initial_condition.nc: This dataset provides ice concentration data from the U.S. National Ice Center. Ice coverage is provided in percentage (0-100%). The NetCDF (.nc) file contains the data for the initial date only (i.e., the first day of the 4-day period for which the weather data is provided for). The horizontal resolution is about 1.3 km. The data is provided at the same 1024x1024 grid as the ice data in the training dataset (ascii and netcdf), as well as the GLSEA data. Note that the netcdf files in the training dataset includes both water surface temperature and ice concentration data, while this file contains only ice concentration. The ice concentration data should provide the same information as glsea_ice_test_initial_condition.nc.
