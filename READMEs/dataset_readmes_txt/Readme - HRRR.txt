Data Description
The HRRR is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-h period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km radar-enhanced Rapid Refresh .

The particular subset of the data provided are surface condition analyses of wind, air temperature, relative humidity, pressure at mean sea level, total cloud cover, and precipitation rate. The data is provided at about 3 km horizontal resolution. 
Data Source
The dataset is obtained from the operational HRRR forecasts.
