U. S. Coast Guard 
Domestic Icebreaking – Operational Scenarios 
The United States Coast Guard plays a critical role in maintaining safe and efficient navigation on the Great Lakes during winter, when waterways of the Marine Transportation System – our Nation’s maritime highways – often freeze, hindering commercial shipping traffic and creating hazards for mariners. The Coast Guard is the only federal agency authorized to conduct domestic icebreaking operations and exercises this authority through two operations on the Great Lakes – Operation Taconite based in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan covering Lake Superior, the St. Mary’s River, the Straits of Mackinac and connecting waterways; and Operation Coal Shovel based in Detroit, Michigan covering the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers and Lake Erie. These domestic icebreaking operations allow for missions such as Search and Rescue and Port Security to continue unimpeded in the winter in addition to preserving reliable ferry access to waterborne communities and sustaining the flow of essential cargoes – such as iron ore, coal, grain, and heating oil – that fuel our regional and national economy. 
Operational planning begins with an assessment of ice conditions. The Coast Guard relies on satellite imagery, aerial reconnaissance, on-scene observations, and partnerships with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Ice Center to track ice formation, thickness, and drift patterns. This data allows icebreakers to plan transit routes, anticipate choke points, and determine the level of support required to escort commercial ships. 
A representative scenario occurs when heavy pack ice threatens to close the St. Mary’s River, blocking the only transit route for ships carrying iron ore from ports in Lake Superior to steel mills in the Midwest. Using the latest forecast and imagery, the Great Lakes Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio tasks icebreakers to establish a navigable track, escort commercial vessels, and maintain key shipping lanes. These well-planned and executed operations preserve the mobility of the Marine Transportation System and minimize costly supply chain disruptions. 
Coast Guard icebreakers must also remain ready to respond to emergencies. A freighter transiting the Straits of Mackinac may become beset in ice when shifting floes trap the vessel and prevent safe maneuvering. The Great Lakes District dispatches the nearest icebreaker. Using updated satellite views of the surrounding ice fields, the icebreaker plans their approach, conducts maneuvers to break the ice surrounding the vessel, and then carves a channel to safe waters. This ensures crew safety, prevents damage to the vessel, and reinforces the Coast Guard’s role as the primary responder to winter maritime emergencies. 
These scenarios are just a small snapshot that highlights the importance of the domestic icebreaking mission and its dependence on reliable environmental data for mission success. Through a combination of forecasting tools, satellite imagery, planning and oversight by Operation Taconite and Operation Coal Shovel, and real-time response by the icebreaker fleet, the Coast Guard ensures both the continuity of
